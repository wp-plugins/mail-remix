== Description ==

*Mail Remix brings HTML email templates to your WordPress installation.*

Emails from WordPress (by default) come in a plaintext format. Mail Remix takes your WordPress emails and spices them up into a **customizable HTML template**.

This template has been checked in some of the most popular email clients, like GMail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Outlook, and others and based off of
code from some of the most popular templates available.

== Installation ==

1. Search for Mail Remix in the WordPress Dashboard
1. Install and Activate

OR

1. Upload plugin to your `wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Activate via the WordPress Dashboard

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if a plugin on my site sends an email that's already templated? =

Mail Remix takes every step possible to keep from interfering with pre-templated emails. If we can detect that an email is already HTML, the email
will be left as-is.
