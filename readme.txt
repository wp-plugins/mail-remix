Take your WordPress emails to the next level with HTML Templates. Replacement Codes, Shortcodes, Markdown, Inline PHP, and more!

== Description ==

Mail Remix brings HTML email templates to your WordPress installation.

Emails from WordPress (by default) come in a plaintext format. Mail Remix takes your WordPress emails and spices them up into a **customizable
HTML template**.

This template has been checked in some of the most popular email clients, like GMail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Outlook, and others and based off of
code from some of the most popular templates available.

### Simplicity is Key

Mail Remix also offers an option to send emails via SMTP, including `FROM` and `RETURN-PATH` HTTP header customization. Need to integrate
with an external mail service? No problem!

### Built With Love

Mail Remix is built with the latest and greatest in PHP version 5.3, and fully commented, documented, and licensed with GPL v3.0. Want

### What's Next?

 - Expanding on the customization options within our base template (Clean)
 - Releasing several new email themes for greater flexibility
 - WordPress Internationalization via I18n

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if a plugin on my site sends an email that's already templated? =

Mail Remix takes every step possible to keep from interfering with pre-templated emails. If we can detect that an email is already HTML, the email
will be left as-is.
